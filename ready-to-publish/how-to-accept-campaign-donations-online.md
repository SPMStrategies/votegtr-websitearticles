# How to Accept Campaign Donations Online

I got a call last week from a school board candidate who'd been live for three weeks but still hadn't set up online donations. "It just seems complicated," she said. "I wanted to get it right."

Meanwhile, her opponent had already raised $8,000 online.

I get it. Between FEC compliance, payment processors, and website integration, donation setup feels like one more technical thing you don't have time to figure out. But here's the reality: if people can't donate to your campaign with two clicks on their phone, you're leaving money on the table.

The good news? You can get this done in about 30 minutes. Here's exactly how.

## Why Online Donations Actually Matter

Let's be clear: online donations won't win your election by themselves. Doors and phones still matter. But try knocking on 10,000 doors without a way for people to contribute when they get home and look you up. Good luck.

Here's what we're seeing across Republican campaigns right now:

**67% of campaign contributions come through digital channels.** Not next year. Right now.

**Mobile donations convert 3x higher than desktop.** Your donors are on their phones at 9 PM, not at their computers.

**Impulse donations happen within 48 hours of contact.** Someone meets you at their door, gets excited, and wants to donate that night. If they have to mail a check or wait until they "remember later," you've lost them.

Bottom line: if accepting donations online feels optional, you're already behind.

## Choosing Your Donation Processor

If you're running as a Republican, you've got two main options: WinRed or Anedot. Both are built specifically for conservative campaigns.

### WinRed (Most Common for Republicans)

WinRed is the official Republican fundraising platform. It's not just a payment processor—it's a complete fundraising ecosystem.

**Pros:**
- Pre-built Republican donor network (people who've donated to GOP candidates before)
- Compliance tools for federal, state, and local races
- Integrates easily with most campaign platforms
- Recurring donation options already set up
- Event ticketing built in

**Cons:**
- Higher fees (3.94% + $0.30 per transaction for credit cards)
- You're locked into their platform

**Best for:** Republican candidates at any level who want access to the established GOP donor network.

### Anedot (Lower Fees, Popular for State/Local)

Anedot is another Republican-friendly platform, particularly popular with state and local campaigns.

**Pros:**
- Lower fees than WinRed (3.5% + $0.30 per transaction)
- Compliance tools for federal and state races
- Text-to-give options
- Good for faith-based and nonprofit fundraising too

**Cons:**
- Smaller donor network than WinRed
- Less name recognition

**Best for:** Republican candidates looking for lower fees, especially at state and local levels.

My take: If you're running for Congress or Senate, WinRed is probably your best bet—the donor network is worth the extra fees. If you're running for state legislature, school board, or county office, Anedot's lower fees make a lot of sense.

## Step-by-Step Setup Process

Okay, let's actually do this. I'm walking you through the WinRed setup since that's what most Republican candidates use. The process for Stripe is similar but with fewer steps.

### Step 1: Create Your WinRed Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to WinRed.com and click "Get Started"
2. Enter your campaign information:
   - Candidate name
   - Office you're running for
   - Campaign committee legal name (exactly as filed with FEC/state)
   - EIN (your campaign's tax ID number)
3. Verify your identity (they'll ask for basic info)
4. Connect your campaign bank account (routing and account numbers)

**Common mistake:** Using your personal bank account instead of your campaign account. Don't do this. WinRed needs to deposit directly into your registered campaign account for FEC compliance.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Donation Page (10 minutes)

WinRed gives you a donation page template. You'll customize:

**Donation amounts:** Set suggested amounts ($25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000). Most campaigns see the best results with lower options—don't just put $100 and up.

**Recurring donations:** Decide if you want to offer monthly recurring gifts. (You should—recurring donors give 5x more over a campaign cycle.)

**Donor information fields:** WinRed collects name, address, email, employer, and occupation automatically (required for FEC compliance). Don't remove these fields.

**Thank you message:** Write a short personal thank you that donors see after giving. Make it warm, not corporate.

**Example:** "Thank you! Your support means everything to this campaign. I'll make you proud. - [Your Name]"

### Step 3: Integrate with Your Website (10 minutes)

This is where people get stuck, but it's easier than you think.

WinRed gives you two options:

**Option A: Embed the donation form directly on your site**
- WinRed provides an embed code (just a few lines)
- Copy and paste it into your website's donation page
- The form appears right there on your site

**Option B: Link to your WinRed donation page**
- WinRed gives you a custom URL (e.g., secure.winred.com/yourname)
- Add a "Donate" button on your site that links there
- Donors click and go to WinRed's secure page

Most campaigns use Option B because it's simpler and more secure. WinRed handles all the payment security and compliance on their end.

If you're using a campaign website platform (like VOTEGTR), this integration is usually one click. The platform already knows how to connect to WinRed—you just enter your WinRed account info and you're done.

### Step 4: Test Your Donation Flow (5 minutes)

Before you announce it to the world, test it yourself.

1. Go to your website and click your "Donate" button
2. Fill out the donation form with test information
3. Use a real credit card but donate $1 to your own campaign (you can't refund test transactions, so keep it small)
4. Complete the donation and verify:
   - Thank you message appears
   - You receive a confirmation email
   - Donation shows up in your WinRed dashboard

If something breaks, fix it before you send the link to actual donors. There's nothing worse than a supporter trying to give you money and hitting an error.

### Step 5: Set Up Confirmation Emails (Optional but Recommended)

WinRed sends automatic receipts, but you should also send a personal follow-up email.

Most email platforms (Mailchimp, Constant Contact) can trigger an email when someone donates. Keep it short:

- Thank them personally
- Remind them why their donation matters
- Invite them to get more involved (volunteer, share on social, etc.)

This turns a one-time donor into an engaged supporter.

## Compliance: Federal vs. State Rules

Everyone panics about campaign finance compliance. Let's clear this up.

**If you're running for Congress or Senate (federal races):**
FEC rules apply. WinRed and Anedot both handle most of this automatically:
- Collecting required donor information (name, address, employer, occupation)
- Generating compliant receipts
- Flagging donations over $200 (you'll need to report these individually)
- Preventing donations over legal limits ($3,300 per person per election as of 2024)

You still need to file your FEC reports on time—the platforms don't file for you, they just collect and organize the data.

**If you're running for state legislature, school board, city council, or any local office:**
FEC doesn't apply to you. You follow your state's campaign finance rules instead.

State rules vary wildly. Some states have contribution limits, some don't. Some require reporting donations over $100, others set the threshold at $1,000. Check with your state or county election board—they'll tell you exactly what applies to your race.

Both WinRed and Anedot work for state and local races too. They collect the donor information you need regardless of which level you're running at.

## Making Your Donation Page Actually Convert

Okay, you've got donations set up. But will people actually give?

Here's what makes a difference:

### Mobile-First Design

67% of donors give on their phones. If your donation button is tiny, hidden, or doesn't work on mobile, you're done.

Test this: Pull out your phone right now and try to donate to your campaign. Can you do it in under 30 seconds without zooming or scrolling sideways? If not, fix it.

### Clear, Prominent Donate Button

Your "Donate" button should be:
- Visible on every page (usually top-right corner)
- High contrast color (stands out from the rest of the page)
- Says "Donate" (not "Contribute" or "Support"—people search for "donate")

### Suggested Amounts That Make Sense

Don't just offer $500 and $1000 donation options. Most donors give $25-$100.

Try this spread: $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, Other

The "Other" option lets people enter any amount. Some will give $5, some will give $2,000. Both matter.

### Urgency (When It's Real)

If you have a real deadline—end of quarter, primary election, filing deadline—mention it.

"We need to raise $5,000 before our FEC filing deadline on Friday" works because it's true and specific.

"Donate now before it's too late!!!" feels desperate and fake. Don't do that.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

I see the same mistakes over and over. Don't be that campaign.

**Waiting too long to set this up.** You should be accepting donations the day you launch your website. Every day you wait is money you're not raising.

**Making it too complicated.** If someone has to create an account, verify their email, and click through three pages to donate $25, they'll quit. Two clicks maximum.

**Only asking once.** You need a donate button on every page, in every email, and in your social media profiles. People donate when it's convenient for them, not when you think they should.

**Forgetting mobile.** Test on your phone. If it doesn't work perfectly there, fix it before you do anything else.

**Not following up.** Someone just gave you money. Send them a personal thank you email within 24 hours. Not an auto-receipt—an actual thank you.

## What Happens After Someone Donates

Here's the typical flow:

1. Donor completes the form and submits payment
2. WinRed (or your processor) charges their card immediately
3. Donor receives an automatic email receipt (required for FEC)
4. Funds are deposited into your campaign account within 3-7 business days
5. You send a personal follow-up thank you (do this manually or with email automation)
6. Donation appears in your WinRed dashboard for FEC reporting

For donations over $200, you'll need to report them individually on your next FEC filing. WinRed flags these for you—just export the data when it's time to file.

## How Much Does This Cost?

Let's talk fees because everyone asks.

**WinRed:**
- Credit cards: 3.94% + $0.30 per transaction
- ACH bank transfers: 3.94% (no flat fee)

So a $100 donation costs you $4.24 in fees. You keep $95.76.

**Anedot:**
- Credit cards: 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction
- ACH bank transfers: 1% + $0.30

Same $100 donation costs you $3.80 in fees. You keep $96.20.

Is the savings worth switching from WinRed to Anedot? Depends. If you're running for Congress or Senate and want access to WinRed's established donor network, the extra 0.44% is probably worth it. If you're running for state legislature or local office, Anedot's lower fees add up over a campaign cycle.

## Getting Started Today

Look, I know this feels like one more thing on your list. But here's the reality: campaigns that can't accept donations online raise about 40% less than campaigns that can.

You don't need a perfect donation page. You need a working donation page. You can always improve it later. You can't improve what doesn't exist.

If you're stuck on any of this, I'm happy to walk you through it. No charge, no pitch—just a conversation about what makes sense for your campaign. Reach out anytime.

And if you want a platform that handles all of this automatically—donation integration, mobile optimization, FEC-compliant forms—that's exactly why we built VOTEGTR. Take a look: [votegtr.com/pricing](https://votegtr.com/pricing)
