# The Complete Guide to Managing Multiple Client Campaign Websites in 5 Simple Steps

I talked to a Republican consultant last week who was managing seven different campaigns. She had three candidates calling her about website updates, two with broken donation buttons, and one who couldn't remember their login credentials. All before 10 AM.

"I spend more time being tech support than actually consulting," she told me.

Sound familiar?

Here's the problem: you got into political consulting to help Republicans win elections, not to wrangle seven different WordPress logins or explain DNS settings for the third time this week. But when you're managing multiple client websites, that's exactly where you end up.

The good news? There's a better way to handle managing multiple client websites without hiring a digital director for every campaign.

## Why Managing Multiple Client Websites Is Harder Than It Should Be

Let's be clear about what you're actually doing when you manage campaign websites for multiple clients.

You're not just building websites. You're managing:

**Five different hosting accounts** with five different login portals and five different billing systems.

**Seven sets of website credentials** that your candidates keep forgetting (and emailing you about at 11 PM).

**Donation platform integrations** that break every time WinRed or Anedot updates something.

**"Quick fixes"** that turn into three-hour troubleshooting sessions because the website builder your client's nephew recommended doesn't actually work on mobile.

And here's what kills me: you're doing all of this instead of what you're actually good at—helping candidates win.

We're seeing this across Republican consultants right now. The average political consultant spends 12-15 hours per week on website-related issues during campaign season. That's almost two full workdays just keeping sites running.

That's not consulting. That's digital firefighting.

## The Real Cost of Managing Multiple Client Websites the Old Way

Before we get into solutions, let's talk about what this is actually costing you.

**Your time.** At 12-15 hours per week on website management, you're losing 25-30% of your billable capacity. If you bill at $150/hour, that's $1,800-$2,250 per week you could be earning on actual consulting work.

**Your profit margins.** When clients pay for consulting but get tech support, your effective hourly rate drops. You're making less per hour while working more.

**Your client relationships.** Nothing makes you look less like a strategic consultant than having to Google "why isn't my WordPress SSL certificate working" during a campaign meeting.

**Your sanity.** I've talked to consultants who keep website credentials in a spreadsheet, on Post-it notes, and in their text message history with candidates. One told me he has a recurring nightmare about losing access to all his clients' sites at once.

Bottom line: managing multiple client websites the traditional way doesn't scale. You can handle two, maybe three campaigns. After that, something breaks—either the websites or you.

## What Professional Consultants Do Differently When Managing Multiple Client Websites

The consultants who make this work don't have more hours in the day. They just stopped trying to manage seven different systems for seven different clients.

Here's their approach in five steps:

### Step 1: Use One Platform for All Your Clients

This is the single biggest change that makes everything else possible.

Instead of juggling different website builders, hosting providers, and management systems for each client, you set up all your campaigns on one platform built specifically for political websites.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

**One login.** You access all your client websites from a single dashboard. No more hunting for passwords or resetting credentials.

**One billing relationship.** Instead of managing five different hosting bills and trying to get reimbursed by campaigns, you have one invoice. Pass the cost to clients or mark it up—your choice.

**One support system.** When something breaks, you're not calling different support lines or digging through different knowledge bases. One platform, one support team that understands campaign websites.

**One integration process.** Set up WinRed once, and you know how it works across all your campaigns. Same with email platforms, social media, analytics—learn it once, replicate it for every client.

I know what you're thinking: "Won't all my clients' sites look the same?"

No. Just because they're on the same platform doesn't mean they look identical. Think about it—half the websites on the internet run on WordPress, and they don't all look the same.

What you get is *operational* consistency without *design* sameness. Your clients each get custom sites that match their campaigns. You get a system that actually scales.

### Step 2: Create Templates for Common Campaign Needs

Once all your clients are on the same platform, the next step is to stop rebuilding the same things over and over.

Every Republican campaign needs roughly the same pages:
- Homepage with candidate bio and key message
- Issues page (usually 3-5 priority issues)
- Donation page with WinRed or Anedot integration
- Events calendar
- Contact/volunteer signup form
- Meet the candidate page
- Endorsements page

Instead of designing these from scratch for every client, you build templates once and customize them for each campaign.

Here's how professional consultants structure this:

**Create three base templates:**
- Template A: First-time candidate, simple messaging, budget-conscious
- Template B: Incumbent or experienced candidate, more content, higher budget
- Template C: Competitive race, aggressive messaging, full-featured

**Customize the details:**
- Swap in client's colors, photos, and messaging
- Adjust issue priorities based on district
- Add or remove sections based on campaign strategy

**Deploy in 24-48 hours** instead of 2-3 weeks.

One consultant I work with uses this approach for state legislative candidates. She can launch a new client website in under 4 hours now. Before templates, it took her 15-20 hours per site.

That's not cutting corners. That's working smart.

The content is still custom for each candidate. The strategy is still tailored to each race. You're just not wasting time reinventing the technical infrastructure every single time.

### Step 3: Set Clear Boundaries on What You Manage (and What You Don't)

Here's where a lot of consultants get underwater: they say yes to every website request because they're worried about losing the client.

Bad idea.

You need clear boundaries on what you manage and what you don't. Otherwise, you'll spend half your day helping candidates update their events calendar or change a photo on their bio page.

**What professional consultants manage:**
- Initial website setup and deployment
- Core configuration (domain, hosting, integrations)
- Major updates and redesigns
- Technical issues and troubleshooting
- Performance monitoring

**What they DON'T manage:**
- Daily content updates (candidates or staff handle this)
- Minor text edits
- Photo swaps
- Event calendar additions
- Blog post publishing

The key is making sure clients can handle the day-to-day stuff themselves. If your platform requires a developer to change a photo, you're using the wrong platform.

Give clients admin access with clear instructions on how to update their own content. Send them a 10-minute video walkthrough. Set up a shared document with FAQs for common tasks.

Then enforce the boundary. When a client emails asking you to change their events page, reply with: "You can update that yourself—here's the quick guide we sent you. Let me know if you hit any technical issues, but this should take you about 2 minutes."

They'll figure it out. And you'll get your time back for actual consulting work.

### Step 4: Monitor All Client Sites from One Dashboard

You can't effectively manage multiple client websites if you have to log into each one individually to check if things are working.

Professional consultants use centralized monitoring to keep an eye on all their campaigns at once.

**What you should be able to see at a glance:**
- Which sites are live vs. still in development
- Traffic and donation metrics for each campaign
- Uptime status (is the site actually accessible?)
- Security alerts or issues
- Upcoming renewals or expiration dates

Most campaign website platforms built for consultants include this kind of dashboard. You log in once and see the status of all your clients.

Here's why this matters: when a candidate calls you panicking that their website is down, you can check your dashboard in 10 seconds and either confirm the issue or tell them it's working fine (because half the time, it's their internet connection, not your website).

The monitoring dashboard also helps you look like the proactive consultant you want to be. You spot a problem and fix it before the client even notices. That's the kind of service that gets you referrals.

### Step 5: Build a Handoff Process for After the Election

Here's something most consultants don't think about until it's too late: what happens to client websites after the election?

If your candidate wins, they'll probably want to keep the site for constituent communications. If they lose, they might want to shut it down or repurpose it for a future run.

Either way, you need a clean handoff process so you're not managing websites forever for clients who are no longer paying you.

**For winning candidates:**
- Transfer admin access to their official staff
- Provide documentation for ongoing updates
- Offer a maintenance retainer (optional revenue stream)
- Set a clear end date for your technical support

**For candidates who don't win:**
- Archive the site or take it offline
- Export any data they want to keep (email lists, donation records)
- Cancel hosting/platform subscription
- Return the domain to the candidate

The key is having this conversation *before* Election Day, not three months later when they're still emailing you about website updates.

One consultant I know includes an "End of Campaign Transition" clause in every contract. Sixty days after the election, either the client transitions to a maintenance retainer or the site gets archived. No exceptions.

Clean handoffs protect your time and keep your client roster manageable.

## The Biggest Mistakes Consultants Make Managing Multiple Client Websites

I see the same mistakes over and over. Don't be that consultant.

**Mistake 1: Using different platforms for different clients.**

You think you're giving clients options. What you're actually doing is tripling your workload. Pick one platform and standardize.

**Mistake 2: Trying to be tech support for free.**

Your consulting fee should not include unlimited website troubleshooting. Set boundaries and stick to them.

**Mistake 3: Not giving clients enough access.**

If candidates can't update their own content, you'll spend 10 hours a week making minor edits. Teach them once, then let them handle it.

**Mistake 4: Managing websites manually instead of using tools.**

There are platforms built specifically for managing multiple campaign websites. Use them. Don't try to reinvent the wheel with generic web hosting.

**Mistake 5: Keeping clients forever.**

Set clear end dates. Either they transition to a maintenance contract or you hand off the site. Don't manage sites indefinitely for clients who aren't paying you.

## What to Look For in a Platform for Managing Multiple Client Websites

If you're ready to stop juggling seven different systems, here's what to look for in a political website platform:

**Multi-client dashboard.** You should see all your campaigns from one login.

**Template library.** Pre-built layouts you can customize for each client.

**Client admin access.** Candidates can update their own content without you.

**Built-in integrations.** WinRed, Anedot, email platforms, social media—already set up.

**White-label options.** Some consultants want to brand the platform as their own service. Make sure that's possible if it matters to you.

**Transparent pricing.** You should know exactly what each client site costs so you can price your services accordingly.

**Republican campaign focus.** Platforms built for political campaigns understand compliance, donation processing, and campaign timelines better than generic website builders.

**Reliable support.** When something breaks at 9 PM on a Saturday before Election Day, you need support that actually responds.

We built VOTEGTR specifically for consultants managing multiple Republican campaigns. One dashboard, one platform, one support team. You can manage five clients or fifty clients using the same system.

Most consultants tell us they save 10-15 hours per week once they consolidate everything onto one platform. That's time you can spend doing actual consulting work instead of resetting passwords and troubleshooting DNS settings.

## How to Transition Your Current Clients to a Better System

If you're already managing multiple client websites the old way, you might be wondering how to make the switch without disrupting active campaigns.

Here's the cleanest approach:

**For current campaigns:** Let them finish the cycle on their existing setup. Don't change systems mid-campaign unless something is fundamentally broken.

**For new campaigns:** Start immediately. Every new client goes on the new platform from day one.

**After Election Day:** Transition winning candidates to the new platform during the post-election site refresh. They'll appreciate the upgrade.

Within 6-12 months, you'll have all your active clients on one system. And managing multiple client websites will finally feel manageable again.

## Real Talk: Why This Actually Matters

Look, I'm not going to tell you that fixing your website management system will win you more elections. Doors and phones still matter more than dashboards.

But here's what it will do:

**Give you your time back.** Instead of spending 15 hours a week on tech support, spend 2 hours. Use the other 13 to do the work that actually makes you money.

**Improve your margins.** When you're not burning hours on website firefighting, your consulting hours are worth more. You make more per client without charging more.

**Make you look like a pro.** Nothing says "strategic consultant" like having your operational infrastructure dialed in. When you can deploy a new client site in 24 hours and monitor all your campaigns from one dashboard, clients notice.

**Scale your practice.** Right now, you're probably maxed out at 5-7 campaigns because of the operational overhead. With the right system, you can handle 15-20 without adding staff.

That's the real reason to fix how you're managing multiple client websites. Not because it's sexy or exciting. Because it's the bottleneck keeping you from growing your consulting practice.

## Getting Started Today

If you're stuck managing seven different website systems for seven different clients, here's what to do next:

**Step 1:** Stop taking on new clients using your old system. Seriously. Stop digging the hole deeper.

**Step 2:** Evaluate political website platforms built for consultants. Look for the features I mentioned earlier—multi-client dashboard, templates, integrations, support.

**Step 3:** Set up one test campaign on the new platform. See how it works. Make sure it does what you need before you commit.

**Step 4:** Transition your next three new clients to the new system. Build your confidence managing it before you switch everyone.

**Step 5:** After the next election cycle, consolidate your active clients onto one platform.

That's it. You don't have to fix everything overnight. Just stop making the problem worse and start moving in the right direction.
