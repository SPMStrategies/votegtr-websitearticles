Every piece of content should feel:

- Helpful, never salesy
- Based on real-world experience
- Empathetic to reader challenges
- Written by a human who's been there

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Conversational and Approachable

**Write like you're talking to someone, not at them.**

✅ Good:
"Here's something I see all the time: candidates spend weeks trying to get their website perfect before launch. Meanwhile, their opponent is already online raising money."

❌ Avoid:
"Organizations that delay digital deployment while pursuing perfection often experience competitive disadvantage in the fundraising landscape."

### Empathetic and Understanding

**Acknowledge the reader's frustration before offering solutions.**

✅ Good:
"I get it. Setting up online donations feels overwhelming when you're already managing a hundred other things. Between FEC compliance, platform choices, and website integration, it's easy to get stuck."

❌ Avoid:
"Online donation setup is a simple 3-step process that takes only 15 minutes."

### Helpful, Not Salesy

**Position as consultant offering advice, not vendor pushing product.**

✅ Good:
"If you're stuck on this, I'm happy to talk it through. No charge, no sales pitch—just a conversation about what might work for your campaign."

❌ Avoid:
"Sign up for VOTEGTR today and solve all your campaign website problems! Limited time offer!"

### Short and Scannable

**Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max) and simple language.**

✅ Good:
"Mobile traffic accounts for 67% of campaign website visits. That's not a prediction—it's what we're seeing right now across hundreds of Republican campaigns.

If your site doesn't work perfectly on phones, you're losing donations. It's that simple."

❌ Avoid:
"Mobile traffic accounts for 67% of campaign website visits, which is not a prediction but rather empirical data from hundreds of Republican campaigns, and if your site doesn't work perfectly on phones then you're losing donations because modern voters expect seamless mobile experiences."

### Light Touch of Personality

**Self-awareness and occasional humor when it fits naturally.**

✅ Good:
"Look, I'm not going to tell you that websites win elections. Doors and phones still matter. But try knocking on 10,000 doors without a website where people can donate. Good luck."

❌ Avoid:
"According to industry research, digital infrastructure correlates with fundraising capacity enhancement."

## What to Avoid (Anti-Patterns)

### Marketing Jargon and Corporate Speak

❌ "Leverage our platform to maximize your digital ROI"
❌ "Best-in-class solutions for mission-critical objectives"
❌ "Synergize your campaign infrastructure"
❌ "Revolutionary paradigm shift in political technology"
❌ "Cutting-edge innovative solutions"

### Sales Trigger Words and Phrases

❌ "Exclusive opportunity"
❌ "Limited time offer"
❌ "Sign up now before it's too late"
❌ "Don't miss out"
❌ "Special pricing for early adopters"
❌ "Act now"
❌ "Once-in-a-lifetime"

### Overselling and Exaggeration

❌ "VOTEGTR will transform your entire campaign"
❌ "Guaranteed to win your election"
❌ "The only platform you'll ever need"
❌ "Completely revolutionize how campaigns work"
❌ "Instant results with zero effort"

### Generic or Vague Statements

❌ "We provide quality service"
❌ "Our team is dedicated to excellence"
❌ "We care about your success"
❌ "Industry-leading solutions"
❌ "World-class support"

## Content Structure Pattern

Every article should follow this natural flow (not a rigid formula, but a guiding pattern):

### 1. Real-World Frustration or Scenario

Start with something Sean sees regularly in the field. Make it specific and relatable.

**Example:**
"I was talking to a first-time school board candidate last week who'd spent $2,000 on a website that still wasn't live three weeks after his filing deadline. His consultant kept saying 'almost done' while his opponent was already raising money online."

### 2. Empathetic Recognition

Acknowledge why this is frustrating or difficult. Make the reader feel understood.

**Example:**
"This happens more often than it should. You're told a website is simple, then you're drowning in technical decisions you never wanted to make. Meanwhile, you've got a campaign to run."

### 3. Clear Explanation or Insight

Share what's actually happening and why. Use plain language.

**Example:**
"Here's the thing: most web developers don't specialize in political campaigns. They're building the same way they'd build a site for a restaurant or a law firm. That works fine—until you need ActBlue integration, FEC-compliant donation forms, and the ability to update your events page yourself at 11 PM on a Tuesday."

### 4. Practical Guidance or Solution

Offer actionable advice based on real experience.

**Example:**
"If you're starting from scratch, look for platforms built specifically for campaigns. They've already solved the donation processing, compliance, and mobile optimization problems. You're not their first rodeo."

### 5. Natural, Varied Closing

End with a conversational invitation or helpful thought—not a hard sales pitch. **Vary the endings** so they feel human-written, not templated.

**Example Closings (vary these):**

**Casual conversation offer:**
"If you're stuck on this, happy to talk it through. No charge, no pitch—just a conversation. Reach out anytime."

**Helpful resource mention:**
"Want to see what a campaign-specific platform looks like? We built VOTEGTR specifically for this. Take a look—no signup required."

**Simple encouragement:**
"Bottom line: don't let website complexity slow down your campaign. There are solutions built for exactly this problem."

**Question prompt:**
"Running into this on your campaign? Let me know what you're dealing with—I've probably seen it before."

**Practical next step:**
"If this sounds familiar, I wrote a full breakdown of what to look for in a campaign website platform. Check it out here: [link]"

**Straight advice:**
"My two cents: get something live fast, even if it's not perfect. You can always improve it. You can't improve what doesn't exist."

---

## Paragraph and Sentence Structure

### Paragraph Length

**Maximum: 2-3 sentences per paragraph**

This improves readability on mobile and helps readers scan quickly.

✅ Good:
"Mobile traffic is 67% of visits. If your site doesn't work on phones, you're losing donations.

That's not a future problem. It's happening right now."

❌ Too Long:
"Mobile traffic is 67% of visits and if your site doesn't work on phones you're losing donations and that's not a future problem because it's happening right now across campaigns everywhere and you need to fix it immediately before you lose more money."

### Sentence Variety

**Mix short punchy sentences with slightly longer explanatory ones.**

✅ Good:
"Here's what I see happen. A candidate launches their website, sets up donations, and waits for money to roll in. It doesn't. They get frustrated and assume online fundraising doesn't work."

❌ Monotonous:
"Candidates launch websites. They set up donations. They wait for money. It doesn't come. They get frustrated. They assume it doesn't work."

### Active Voice Preference

**Use active voice most of the time. Passive voice occasionally when it sounds more natural.**

✅ Active (preferred):
"Your opponent is already raising money online while you're still picking fonts."

⚠️ Passive (use sparingly):
"Fonts are being selected while money is being raised by your opponent."

---

## Author Attribution Approach

### Vary Author Attribution

**Don't always use the same byline. Mix it up based on content type:**

**"By Sean Murphy"** - For personal experience pieces, consultant insights, field observations
**"VOTEGTR Team"** - For technical guides, feature explanations, product updates
**"Sean Murphy, VOTEGTR"** - For mixed content that's both personal and informational
**No byline** - When it doesn't matter or feels forced

**Guideline**: If the article includes Sean's personal experience or field stories, attribute to Sean Murphy. If it's purely educational or technical, VOTEGTR Team is fine.

---

## When to Include Personal Stories

### Use Personal Anecdotes When They Fit Naturally

**Include a story from Sean's consulting experience when:**
- It illustrates the exact pain point being discussed
- It makes the reader feel less alone in their struggle
- It demonstrates real-world consequences
- It adds authenticity and credibility

**Skip personal stories when:**
- The topic is technical/instructional and a story would slow it down
- A generic example works just as well
- It feels forced or shoehorned in
- The article already has strong empathy and relatability

### Personal Story Examples

✅ **Fits naturally** (article about website delays):
"I was on a call last month with a county commission candidate who'd been waiting six weeks for their web developer to 'finish up a few things.' Their primary was in eight weeks. Do the math."

✅ **Fits naturally** (article about donation setup):
"I can't count how many times I've heard this: 'My website is live but I haven't set up donations yet because it seems complicated.' Meanwhile, donations are literally the point."

❌ **Forced** (article about mobile optimization):
"I once worked with a candidate—let's call him Bob—who didn't optimize for mobile, and I told Bob that Bob should really think about mobile because mobile is important and Bob learned that mobile matters."

---

## Call-to-Action (CTA) Guidelines

### Soft, Conversational CTAs

**VOTEGTR CTAs prioritize relationship-building over hard conversions.**

The goal is to invite conversation, not push a sale.

### Vary CTA Style and Language

**Don't use the same CTA every time. Mix these approaches:**

**Casual conversation invitation:**
"Dealing with this on your campaign? Let's talk. No charge, no pitch—just a conversation about what might work for you."

**Helpful resource offer:**
"I put together a full guide on this if you want to dig deeper: [link]. No signup required, just helpful info."

**Simple next step:**
"If this sounds like what you're running into, check out how VOTEGTR handles it: [link]"

**Question-based engagement:**
"Sound familiar? I'd be curious to hear what you're dealing with. Reach out anytime."

**Acknowledgment + invitation:**
"This stuff is more complicated than it should be. Happy to walk through it with you if it helps—just let me know."

**Direct but friendly:**
"We built VOTEGTR specifically to solve this problem. Take a look: [link]. No commitment, just see if it fits."

**Encouraging sign-off:**
"Don't let this slow you down. There are good solutions out there—find one that works and keep moving."

### What NOT to Do in CTAs

❌ "Sign up now before this offer expires!"
❌ "Limited time special pricing—act fast!"
❌ "Join thousands of winning campaigns today!"
❌ "Don't miss this exclusive opportunity!"
❌ "Click here to revolutionize your campaign!"
❌ "Get started free—no credit card required!" (sounds desperate)

### CTA Placement

**End of article**: Always include a natural, conversational CTA
**Mid-article**: Only if it fits naturally in the flow (e.g., "More on that here: [link]")
**Multiple CTAs**: Avoid. One clear, authentic invitation is better than three sales pitches.

---

## Language and Word Choice

### Use Simple, Direct Language

**Write at an 8th-grade reading level. Use plain English.**

✅ Simple:
"Your website needs to work on phones."

❌ Overcomplicated:
"Mobile optimization is imperative for contemporary digital engagement strategies."

### Be Specific, Not Vague

**Use concrete numbers, examples, and scenarios.**

✅ Specific:
"67% of campaign website traffic comes from mobile devices. If your donation button doesn't work on an iPhone, you're losing two out of every three potential donors."

❌ Vague:
"Most people use mobile devices these days, so mobile-friendly websites are important for maximizing engagement."

### Use "You" Language

**Address the reader directly. Make it personal.**

✅ Direct:
"You're running a campaign, not a tech startup. You need tools that work, not homework."

❌ Impersonal:
"Campaigns require functional tools rather than complex technical implementations."

### Contractions Are Fine

**Write how people actually talk.**

✅ Natural:
"It's not complicated, but it's easy to get wrong."

⚠️ Stiff (sometimes okay, but less preferred):
"It is not complicated, but it is easy to get wrong."

---

## Content Topics and Framing

### Frame Topics as Real-World Challenges Sean Sees

**Every article should address a frustration, question, or pattern Sean encounters regularly.**

✅ Good Topic Framing:
"I keep seeing first-time candidates make the same mistake with donation setup..."

❌ Generic Topic Framing:
"This article will explain the technical process of configuring online donation processing systems."

### Focus on Reader Value, Not VOTEGTR Features

**Lead with what the reader gets, not what VOTEGTR offers.**

✅ Reader-focused:
"You can accept your first online donation in under 30 minutes. Here's how."

❌ Product-focused:
"VOTEGTR offers seamless donation integration with one-click setup and enterprise-grade security."

### Acknowledge Complexity, Then Simplify

**Don't pretend hard things are easy. Acknowledge the challenge, then make it manageable.**

✅ Honest:
"FEC compliance for online donations sounds intimidating—and yeah, there are rules to follow. But most of it boils down to three things: [...]"

❌ Dismissive:
"FEC compliance is super easy! Just follow these 47 steps and you're done!"

## Segment-Specific Voice Adjustments

While the core voice stays consistent, subtle adjustments for each audience:

### Candidates

**Tone**: Reassuring, empathetic, hand-holding available
**Language**: Simple, non-technical
**Focus**: "You don't need to be a tech expert"
**Pain Points**: Overwhelm, time pressure, not knowing what they need

**Example:**
"You filed last week and now everyone's asking for your website. Deep breath—you don't need a tech degree to get this done."

---

### Consultants

**Tone**: Professional peer-to-peer, high-energy problem-solving
**Language**: Can be slightly more technical, but still conversational
**Focus**: Time savings, profit margins, making clients happy
**Pain Points**: Workload, appearing tech-savvy, client management

**Example:**
"You're managing five campaigns and they all need websites. You don't have time to babysit five different web developers—and you definitely don't have budget to hire a digital director for each one."

---

### Party Chairs

**Tone**: Patriotic, friendly, respectful of volunteer service
**Language**: Simple, accessible (volunteers, not pros)
**Focus**: Supporting all Republican candidates, bulk value
**Pain Points**: Limited expertise, budget constraints, helping multiple candidates

**Example:**
"You've got 12 Republican candidates running in your county this cycle. Getting every one of them online shouldn't require a second mortgage or a computer science degree."

---

### Current Customers

**Tone**: Insider knowledge, partner-in-success, VIP treatment
**Language**: Can reference platform specifics they already know
**Focus**: Optimization, new features, exclusive insights
**Pain Points**: Getting more from platform, staying competitive

**Example:**
"You're already up and running with VOTEGTR—nice. Here's a feature most people don't know about that could double your donation conversion rate."

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Donation Setup Article

❌ **Corporate/Salesy Version:**
"VOTEGTR's revolutionary donation platform enables seamless integration with industry-leading payment processors, providing best-in-class FEC compliance automation and maximizing your fundraising ROI. Sign up today for exclusive early-adopter pricing!"

✅ **VOTEGTR Voice:**
"Setting up donations shouldn't take a week. You pick your processor (ActBlue or WinRed, usually), connect it to your site, and you're done.

The FEC stuff sounds scary, but it's mostly automatic if you're using the right tools. I'm happy to walk you through it if you get stuck—no charge, just a conversation."

---

### Example 2: Mobile Optimization Article

❌ **Generic/Technical Version:**
"Mobile optimization is a critical component of modern web design. Responsive frameworks ensure cross-device compatibility and enhance user experience metrics. Implementation requires CSS media queries and viewport meta tags."

✅ **VOTEGTR Voice:**
"Here's the thing: 67% of people visiting your campaign site are on their phones. If your donation button doesn't work on an iPhone, you just lost two out of three donors.

This isn't a future problem. It's happening right now. And it's fixable—your website platform should handle this automatically. If it doesn't, find one that does."

---

### Example 3: Consultant Time-Saving Article

❌ **Feature-Focused Version:**
"VOTEGTR offers multi-client dashboard management capabilities with white-label customization options and scalable infrastructure to support high-volume political consulting operations."

✅ **VOTEGTR Voice:**
"You're managing four campaigns. They all need websites. You don't have time to wrangle four different web developers, and you definitely don't want four panicked client calls when something breaks.

What if you could give every client a professional site and manage them all from one place? No juggling passwords, no coordinating with multiple vendors. Just done.

That's what we built VOTEGTR for. Take a look: [link]."
