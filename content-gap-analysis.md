# VOTEGTR Content Gap Analysis

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of content gaps on VOTEGTR.com, identifying missing topics that prevent effective segment coverage, conversion optimization, and topical authority. It serves as the foundation for strategic content planning and prioritization.

**Analysis Date**: October 20, 2025
**Website Analyzed**: VOTEGTR.com
**Analysis Method**: Sitemap audit + Vault alignment review

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State
VOTEGTR.com has a strong foundation of awareness-stage content focused primarily on candidates, with emphasis on cost avoidance and platform comparison topics. However, significant gaps exist in segment coverage, conversion funnel depth, and practical implementation guidance.

### Critical Findings
- **Consultant segment**: 0% content coverage (complete gap)
- **Current customer segment**: 0% content coverage (complete gap)
- **Party chair segment**: ~10% coverage (severely underdeveloped)
- **Candidate segment**: 90% coverage (overrepresented)
- **Conversion funnel**: Heavy top-of-funnel, weak middle and bottom
- **Practical guides**: Missing core "how-to" implementation content

### Recommended Action
Prioritize filling segment representation gaps first (Consultants, Current Customers, Party Chairs), then address core pain point gaps, followed by conversion funnel balancing.
