## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Creation (AI)

**AI Actions:**
1. Select topic from approved content calendar
2. Reference vault repository for segment messaging
3. Draft article following SEO guidelines
4. Save to `/drafts/[article-slug].md`
5. Notify you: "New article ready for review: [Title]"

**File Location**: `/drafts/article-name.md`

**Notification Format:**
```
üìù New Article Ready for Review

Title: How to Accept Campaign Donations Online
Segment: Candidates
Target Keyword: campaign donations online
Word Count: 2,150
Status: Awaiting your review in /drafts/

Review at: /Users/Sean/VOTEGTR-WebsiteArticles/drafts/accept-campaign-donations-online.md
```

### Phase 2: Your Review & Approval

**Your Actions:**

2. Review content for:
   - Messaging alignment with vault
   - Accuracy of VOTEGTR features/pricing
   - Segment appropriateness

   - Overall quality

**Decision Options:**

**Option A: Approve**
- Tell AI: "Approved" or "Approve [article name]"

**Option B: Request Revisions**

### Phase 3: WordPress Upload (AI - Automated)

**AI Actions:**
1. Move approved article from `/drafts/` to `/ready-to-publish/`
2. Convert markdown to WordPress HTML
3. Upload to WordPress via REST API with:

**Note for articles 2,500+ words:** AI will convert the full markdown to HTML and save to a temp file, then use WordPress REST API to update the post content in a separate call after initial post creation. This ensures full article content is uploaded automatically regardless of length.

**Standard upload includes:**
   - **Status**: Draft (not published)
   - **Title**: SEO-optimized title
   - **Content**: Full HTML formatted article
   - **Meta Title**: SEO title tag (Rank Math)
   - **Meta Description**: SEO description (Rank Math)
   - **Focus Keyword**: Primary keyword (Rank Math)
   - **URL Slug**: SEO-friendly slug
   - **Category**: Assigned based on topic
   - **Author**: Sean Murphy (ID: 12)
   - **Excerpt**: Auto-generated or custom

4. Return WordPress draft information:
   - Draft ID
   - Edit URL (for human assistant)
   - Preview URL
   - Category assigned

**Example Output:**

## Technical Implementation

### Creating a Draft Post (API Call)

```bash
curl -X POST --user "sean@spmstrategies.com:UhVn E9aZ pCoy vvlY 55lb QnWe" \
  https://votegtr.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Article Title Here",
    "content": "<p>HTML content here...</p>",
    "status": "draft",
    "slug": "article-url-slug",
    "categories": [44],
    "excerpt": "Brief article summary...",
    "meta": {
      "rank_math_title": "SEO Title | VOTEGTR",
      "rank_math_description": "SEO meta description here.",
      "rank_math_focus_keyword": "primary keyword"
    }
  }'
```

### Rank Math SEO Integration

**Important**: Rank Math requires its own API endpoint to properly set metadata.

**Method 1: Rank Math API (Recommended for Focus Keyword)**
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://votegtr.com/wp-json/rankmath/v1/updateMeta' \
  --user 'sean@spmstrategies.com:UhVn E9aZ pCoy vvlY 55lb QnWe' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "objectID": POST_ID,
    "objectType": "post",
    "meta": {
      "rank_math_focus_keyword": "target keyword here"
    }
  }'
```

**Method 2: Standard WordPress Meta (for Title & Description)**
Set via standard `meta` field in post creation:
- `rank_math_title`: Meta title (50-60 chars)
- `rank_math_description`: Meta description (120-160 chars)

---

## Content Calendar Integration

### Content Calendar Tracking

Each article entry in `content-calendar.md` will track:

```markdown
| Title | Segment | Keyword | Status | WP ID | Draft URL | Live URL | Published |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| How to Accept Donations | Candidates | campaign donations | Draft in WP | 2156 | [Edit](https://votegtr.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2156&action=edit) | - | - |
| Managing Client Websites | Consultants | political consultant tools | Approved | - | - | - | - |
```

**Status Values**:
- `Planned` - On content calendar, not yet drafted
- `Drafting` - AI actively writing
- `Review` - In /drafts/ awaiting your approval
- `Approved` - In /ready-to-publish/ awaiting WordPress upload
- `Draft in WP` - Uploaded to WordPress as draft
- `Published` - Live on VOTEGTR.com

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: API Authentication Fails

**Solution**:
- Verify application password hasn't been revoked
- Check username is `sean@spmstrategies.com`
- Regenerate application password if needed

### Issue: Post Won't Save as Draft

**Solution**:
- Check user permissions (should be admin)
- Verify WordPress REST API is enabled
- Check for plugin conflicts (disable temporarily)

### Issue: Rank Math Metadata Not Saving

**Solution**:
- Verify Rank Math plugin is active
- Check meta field names match Rank Math's schema
- May need to set via Rank Math UI instead of API

### Issue: Category Not Assigned

**Solution**:
- Verify category ID is correct (use categories endpoint)
- Ensure user has permission to assign categories
- Check category exists and isn't deleted

### Issue: Internal Links Broken

**Solution**:
- Verify target pages exist before linking
- Use full URLs or proper WordPress relative paths
- Test all links in preview before publishing

## Workflow Optimization Tips

### Batching Content

**Weekly Batch Process**:
- Monday: Review and approve 3-4 drafts from previous week
- Tuesday: AI uploads approved articles to WordPress
- Wednesday: Human assistant reviews WordPress drafts, adds images
- Thursday-Friday: Publish 2-3 articles (spread throughout week)

**Benefits**:
- Consistent publishing schedule
- Efficient use of human review time
- Always have 3-5 articles in pipeline

### Publishing Schedule

**Recommended**:
- Publish 2-3 articles per week
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (peak engagement)
- Avoid: Monday (busy), Friday (low engagement), weekends

**Time of Day**:
- Optimal: 9-11 AM EST (morning browsing)
- Alternative: 2-4 PM EST (afternoon break)
