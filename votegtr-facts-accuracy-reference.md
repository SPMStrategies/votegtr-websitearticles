## Critical Rule

**NEVER guess, assume, or generalize about:**
- Election law and compliance (FEC vs. state)
- Payment processors and platforms
- Technical capabilities or integrations
- Pricing or features of third-party tools
- Legal requirements or deadlines

**If you're not certain about a fact, note it in the draft for human verification.**

## Election Compliance: FEC vs. State

### FEC (Federal Election Commission) Applies ONLY To:
- **U.S. House of Representatives** campaigns
- **U.S. Senate** campaigns
- **Presidential** campaigns
- Federal PACs and committees

### State/Local Election Authorities Apply To:
- **Governor** races
- **State Legislature** (State House, State Senate)
- **County offices** (County Commission, County Executive, etc.)
- **Municipal offices** (Mayor, City Council, etc.)
- **School Board** races
- **Judicial** races (varies by state)
- Local ballot measures and referendums

### Correct Usage in Content

✅ **Correct:**
"If you're running for Congress or Senate, FEC compliance rules apply. If you're running for school board, city council, or state legislature, you'll follow your state's campaign finance rules instead."

❌ **Incorrect:**
"All campaigns need to follow FEC compliance rules."

❌ **Incorrect:**
"School board candidates need to file FEC reports and follow FEC donation limits."

### Key Differences

**FEC (Federal):**
- Contribution limits: $3,300 per individual per election (as of 2024)
- Must report donations over $200 individually
- Quarterly reporting deadlines
- Managed through FEC.gov

**State/Local:**
- Contribution limits vary by state (some have none)
- Reporting thresholds vary by state
- Filing deadlines vary by state
- Managed through state election boards/commissions

**When writing about compliance, always specify which level applies or direct readers to check their state/local rules.**

## Payment Processors for Republican Campaigns

### WinRed (Primary Republican Platform)

**What it is:** Official Republican fundraising platform, built specifically for GOP campaigns and committees.

**Who uses it:**
- Republican candidates at all levels (federal, state, local)
- Republican party committees (RNC, state parties, county parties)
- Conservative PACs and advocacy groups

**Key features:**
- Pre-built Republican donor network
- FEC compliance automation (for federal races)
- Recurring donation setup
- Integration with most campaign platforms

**Fees:**
- Credit cards: 3.94% + $0.30 per transaction
- ACH transfers: 3.94% flat

**Correct usage:** "Most Republican candidates use WinRed for donation processing."

---

### Anedot (Alternative Republican Platform)

**What it is:** Another donation processing platform popular with Republican campaigns, particularly at state and local levels.

**Who uses it:**
- Republican candidates (especially state/local races)
- Conservative nonprofits
- Churches and faith-based organizations
- Campaigns seeking lower fees than WinRed

**Key features:**
- Lower fees than WinRed

- Text-to-give options
- Event ticketing integration

**Fees:**
- Credit cards: 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction (lower than WinRed)
- ACH transfers: 1% + $0.30

**Correct usage:** "Republican campaigns typically use WinRed or Anedot for payment processing."

---

### ActBlue (Democratic Platform - DO NOT RECOMMEND)

**What it is:** Official Democratic fundraising platform.

**Who uses it:** Democratic candidates and progressive organizations.

**VOTEGTR stance:** We serve Republican campaigns. Never recommend ActBlue except in factual comparisons (e.g., "Democrats use ActBlue; Republicans use WinRed").

---

### Stripe (Developer Platform - NOT Campaign-Specific)

**What it is:** General-purpose payment processing API for developers and businesses.

**Who uses it:**
- E-commerce businesses
- SaaS companies
- Developers building custom payment solutions
- Some nonpartisan campaigns with technical resources

**Why NOT recommended for most campaigns:**
- Requires technical integration (not plug-and-play)
- No built-in campaign compliance features
- No donor network access
- Requires separate FEC/state compliance tracking

**Fees:**
- 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (lower than WinRed/Anedot)

**Correct usage:**
"While Stripe has lower fees, it's a developer-focused platform without built-in campaign features. Republican campaigns are better served by WinRed or Anedot, which handle compliance and donor management automatically."

❌ **Incorrect:**
"Republican campaigns should use Stripe for lower fees."

✅ **Correct:**
"Republican campaigns typically use WinRed or Anedot. These platforms are built specifically for political fundraising and include compliance tools, donor networks, and easy integration with campaign websites."

---

### PayPal (Consumer Platform - NOT Recommended for Campaigns)

**What it is:** Consumer payment platform for personal and small business transactions.

**Why NOT recommended:**
- Not designed for political campaigns
- Poor compliance tracking
- No FEC/state reporting tools
- Can freeze accounts for political activity
- Terrible customer service for campaign needs

**Correct usage:** Don't recommend PayPal for campaigns. If asked, explain why WinRed or Anedot are better choices.

## What AI Should Do When Uncertain

### If You Don't Know a Fact:

**Option 1:** Mark it in the draft for human verification
```
[VERIFY: Does Anedot support recurring donations? Need to confirm this feature.]
```

**Option 2:** Use general, safe language
Instead of: "Anedot charges 3.5% per transaction"
Use: "Anedot typically has lower fees than WinRed—check their current pricing for details"

**Option 3:** Direct reader to authoritative source
"For current FEC contribution limits, visit FEC.gov"
"Check your state election board for local campaign finance rules"

### Never Guess About:

❌ Specific fees or pricing (these change)
❌ Legal requirements or deadlines (varies by state/level)
❌ Technical capabilities of third-party platforms
❌ Compliance rules (FEC vs. state)
❌ Statistics without verified source

## Corrections from Recent Drafts

✅ **Correct:** "School board candidates follow state and local campaign finance rules, not federal FEC rules. Check with your county or state election office for specific requirements."

### Issue 2: Stripe as Primary Recommendation

❌ **Incorrect:** "Republican candidates should use Stripe for payment processing"

✅ **Correct:** "Republican campaigns typically use WinRed or Anedot for payment processing. These platforms are built for political fundraising with compliance tools and donor networks built in."

### Issue 3: Overgeneralizing "All Campaigns"

❌ **Incorrect:** "All campaigns must file quarterly FEC reports"

✅ **Correct:** "Federal campaigns (Congress, Senate) file quarterly FEC reports. State and local campaigns follow their state's reporting schedule—check with your state election board."
