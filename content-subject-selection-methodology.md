# VOTEGTR Content Subject Selection Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic process for selecting article topics for VOTEGTR.com. The methodology ensures balanced segment coverage, conversion-focused content, and alignment with vault repository messaging guidelines.

---

## Core Selection Principles

### 1. Segment Rotation
Distribute content evenly across VOTEGTR's four target segments to maintain balanced audience engagement:

- **Candidates** (First-time and incumbent candidates)
- **Consultants** (Political consultants and campaign staff)
- **Party Chairs** (Republican county/district party leadership)
- **Current Customers** (Existing VOTEGTR users)

### 2. Keyword Targeting
Select topics based on actual search behavior of target audiences, prioritizing:
- Search phrases indicating active solution-seeking
- Commercial and transactional intent keywords
- Question-based queries that map to documented pain points
- Moderate competition keywords with sufficient search volume

### 3. Vault Alignment
Every article topic must connect to pain points, messaging angles, or value propositions documented in the `votegtr-vault` repository. If a topic isn't supported by vault guidance, it doesn't get written.

## Monthly Topic Selection Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Segment Allocation

Assign article quantities to each segment based on business priorities and previous month's distribution.

**Typical Monthly Distribution (8-12 articles):**
- **Candidates**: 4 articles (40-50% of content)
- **Consultants**: 3 articles (25-30% of content)
- **Party Chairs**: 2 articles (15-20% of content)
- **Current Customers**: 1-2 articles (10-15% of content)

**Adjustment Factors:**
- Campaign seasonality (primary vs. general election periods)
- Content gap priorities identified in gap analysis
- Business development focus (new segment push, retention emphasis)
- Recent performance data (if available in later phases)

### Step 2: Identify Candidate Topics

For each segment allocation, generate 3-5 potential topics using:

**Keyword Research:**
- Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, Ahrefs, or similar tools
- "People Also Ask" sections in Google search results
- Competitor content analysis
- Search Console queries (if available)

**Vault-Based Ideation:**
- Review segment-specific pain points documented in vault
- Identify messaging angles not yet covered in existing content
- Match product value propositions to educational content opportunities

**Content Gap Analysis:**
- Reference the Content Gap Analysis document
- Prioritize high-priority gaps first
- Address missing funnel stages (awareness, consideration, decision)

### Step 3: Validate Topics Against Criteria

Each potential topic must meet these requirements:

✅ **Vault Alignment**: Connects to documented pain points, messaging, or value propositions
✅ **Search Intent**: Addresses a real query from target audience
✅ **Conversion Potential**: Naturally leads to VOTEGTR solution
✅ **Segment Specificity**: Clearly serves identified segment's needs
✅ **Feasibility**: Can be written authoritatively with available information

**Disqualify topics that:**
- Require speculation beyond vault documentation
- Address generic political topics unrelated to VOTEGTR services
- Duplicate existing content without new angle
- Target audiences outside VOTEGTR's four segments

### Step 4: Map to Conversion Funnel

Ensure monthly content calendar balances across funnel stages:

**Top-of-Funnel (Awareness) - 30-40%**
- Educational content addressing broad challenges
- "What is..." and "Why..." articles
- Industry trends and insights
- Example: "Why Mobile-Responsive Websites Matter for Campaigns"

**Middle-of-Funnel (Consideration) - 30-40%**
- Solution comparison content
- "How to choose..." articles
- Feature/benefit explanations
- Example: "Campaign Website Platforms: What Consultants Need to Know"

**Bottom-of-Funnel (Decision) - 20-30%**
- Implementation guides
- Getting started content
- Objection handling
- Example: "How to Launch Your Campaign Website in 24 Hours"

### Step 5: Sequence for Strategic Impact

Arrange topics within the month to build momentum:

- **Week 1**: Top-of-funnel content (attract new audiences)
- **Week 2**: Middle-funnel content (educate prospects)
- **Week 3**: Bottom-funnel or segment-specific deep dive
- **Week 4**: Social proof, customer story, or feature spotlight

**Clustering Strategy:**
When publishing multiple articles for same segment in one month, sequence them to build on each other (general → specific, problem → solution).

### Step 6: Create Proposed Content Calendar

Document selected topics in a simple format:

| Week | Article Title | Segment | Target Keyword | Funnel Stage | Status |
|------|---------------|---------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | How to Accept Campaign Donations Online | Candidates | campaign donations online | Bottom | Planned |
| 1 | Managing Multiple Client Websites Efficiently | Consultants | political consultant tools | Middle | Planned |
| 2 | Bulk Campaign Websites for County Parties | Party Chairs | county party websites | Middle | Planned |
| 2 | 5 VOTEGTR Features You're Not Using | Current Customers | campaign website features | Top | Planned |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Step 7: Approval Gate

**Human Review Required:**
- Review proposed content calendar
- Approve, modify, or replace topics
- Adjust segment priorities if needed
- Confirm strategic alignment with business goals

**Once approved, AI proceeds to drafting stage.**

## Content Gap-Driven Selection

When conducting initial content gap filling (first 3-6 months), prioritize topics in this order:

### Priority 1: Segment Representation Gaps
Address completely underserved segments first:
1. Consultant content (currently zero)
2. Current customer content (currently zero)
3. Party chair expansion (currently minimal)

### Priority 2: Core Pain Point Gaps
Fill missing content for documented high-priority pain points:
- "How to accept donations online" (Candidate #1 pain point)
- "Managing multiple client sites" (Consultant #1 pain point)
- "Bulk pricing/support" (Party Chair barrier)

### Priority 3: Conversion Funnel Gaps
Balance the funnel by adding:
- Middle-funnel comparison and evaluation content
- Bottom-funnel "getting started" and onboarding content
- Decision-stage objection handling

### Priority 4: Technical/Feature Gaps
Address common questions about platform:
- Integration guides (ActBlue, WinRed, etc.)
- Feature tutorials
- Setup walkthroughs
- Support and service explanations

---

---

## Approval and Documentation

### Monthly Planning Meeting

At the start of each month (or last week of previous month):

1. **Review Previous Month**: What was published, any notable gaps
2. **Business Priorities**: Current focus areas, sales priorities, seasonal factors
3. **Segment Allocation**: Decide distribution for upcoming month
4. **Topic Proposals**: AI presents 8-12 proposed topics with rationale
5. **Calendar Approval**: Human approves, modifies, or requests alternatives
6. **Drafting Authorization**: Once approved, AI begins content creation

### Documentation Requirements

**Content Calendar File** (`content-calendar.md`) must include:

- Target keyword(s)
- Funnel stage

- Planned publish week
- Status (Planned → Drafting → Review → Approved → WP Draft → Published)

---

## Quality Control Checkpoints

Before any topic is approved for drafting:

✅ **Segment Check**: Does this serve one of our four segments clearly?
✅ **Vault Check**: Does this align with documented pain points or messaging?
✅ **Keyword Check**: Is someone actually searching for this?
✅ **Conversion Check**: Does this naturally lead to VOTEGTR solution?
✅ **Differentiation Check**: Is this distinct from existing content?
✅ **Value Check**: Will the target audience find this genuinely useful?

If any checkpoint fails, revise or discard the topic.
